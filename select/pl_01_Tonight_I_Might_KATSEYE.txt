There′s a hundred reasons why
I show
up late and then I don't talk
But I′m tired of focusing on
all the things I don't got
I'm such an overthinker, loner,
the one who misses all the jokes
I′m not the number calling at
four o′clock in the morning
But tonight I might do it a little different
than I didbefore
Different than I did before
Do all of the shit I know I
didn't do when I was a kid
Get high on life for somebody′s kiss
But tonight I might (aye)
Tonight I might,
tonight I might do stupid shit
Pretend these people,
they are my friends
That sing too loud and getcomplicated
Tonight I might (aye)
Tonight I might, tonight I might
I know everyone around me
doesn't move the same way, mm
But it′s kinda fun to be somebody
different on the same day
I'm not the perfect example of
someone ready to handle
The kinda party required to go
in fully inspired by
Tonight I might do it a little
different than I did before
Different than I did before
Do all of the shit I know I didn
′t do when I was a kid
Get high on life for somebody'skiss
But tonight I might (aye)
Tonight I might,
tonight I might do stupid shit
Pretend these people,
they are my friends
That sing too loud and getcomplicated
Tonight I might(aye)
Tonight I might, tonight I might(Aye)
tonight I might, tonight I might(Aye)
tonight I might, tonight I might
